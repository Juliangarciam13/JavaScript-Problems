/* In JavaScript, the for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.
The loop syntax is for (leave variable in object) where variable is a variable that
will contain the name of the property for each iteration, and object is the object to iterate over.
So for(let i in obj) means that for each iteration of the loop, the variable i will contain
the name of the current property being iterated over, and obj is the object being iterated over. The cycle
will be executed for each property on the object.*/
